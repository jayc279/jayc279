A dedicated professional with over 20 years of experience in the technology sector is transitioning into Cybersecurity and Security Analysis. Expertise includes designing and developing automation tools, building infrastructures, software vulnerability analysis, testing, and release management. 

Specialization lies in Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing, with a proactive approach to identifying and mitigating potential security threats. Certifications include CEH (v13) from EC-Council and Junior Penetration Tester. Training on platforms like TryHackMe included completing 95 rooms and earning 16 badges within three weeks, placing in the top 6% of participants. 

Additional experience includes AI prompt engineering and fine-tuning. Excels in collaborative team environments and seeks to identify and prove vulnerabilities, collaborating with development teams to fix security flaws and protect end-users.

**Hobby** I love working on TryHackme, Bug Hunting and CTF (Capture The Flag) projects. Pre-train, fine-tune, and prompt-engineer GenAI-LLM models to mitigate cybersecurity threats.
