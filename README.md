**Since cybersecurity will be the main focus of almost everyone who uses internet via desktop, mobile, IoT, wireless etc., switched career paths to be an Ethical Hacker and Penetration Tester and help in efforts to keep us all safe from cyber threats.**  

*For the past 25+ years had worked in Electronic Design Automation industry, focused on software testing, risk analysis, infrastructure, and web application development, and now combined with penetration testing skills using cybersecurity tools, and experiences in pretraining GenAI LLM models*

**Hobby** I love working on Hacktons, Bug Hunting and CTF (Capture The Flag) projects. Pre-train, fine-tune, and prompt-engineer GenAI-LLM models to mitigate cybersecurity threats.
