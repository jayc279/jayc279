### [Cybersecurity Projects, Simulations, Training](https://github.com/jayc279/CEH)
â€¢ **Scanning and Enumeration**: Used Nmap for network reconnaissance to discover active hosts, open ports, and services. Applied banner grabbing
techniques to identify software versions to search for known vulnerabilities (CVEs).<BR>
â€¢ **Exploitation framework**: Employed Metasploit Framework to select and execute exploits against identified vulnerabilities in systems and network
services, gaining unauthorized access or control.<BR>
â€¢ **Credential attacks**: Leveraged password cracking tools like John the Ripper and Hydra to perform dictionary and brute-force attacks against weak
credentials exposed during reconnaissance.<BR>
â€¢ **Packet sniffing**: Used Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic, identifying unencrypted protocols carrying sensitive data.<BR>
â€¢ **Proxying and Scanning**: Used Burp Suite to intercept, analyze, and manipulate HTTP/S traffic. Ran automated scans for common vulnerabilities
like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).<BR>
â€¢ **Injection**: Utilized SQLmap to automate the detection and exploitation of SQL injection flaws to exfiltrate database content. Wrote custom
payloads to demonstrate XSS vulnerability impacts, such as cookie stealing, XXE. Manual LFI/RFI and command injection to exfiltrate system files.<BR>
â€¢ **Authentication Testing**: Tested for broken authentication and session management by attempting to bypass login mechanisms or hijack active
sessions. Conducted manual testing for business logic vulnerabilities, such as privilege escalation or the misuse of application features.<BR>
â€¢ **SIEM**: Configured and monitored SIEM tools like Splunk, Wazuh, and IBM QRadar to centralize and correlate logs from network devices, servers,
and applications. Created and tuned rules to detect suspicious activities, including port scans and failed login attempts.<BR>
â€¢ **IDS/IPS & Firewalls**: iptables and Snort to detect and block malicious network traffic based on predefined signatures and behavioral anomalies.
Implemented and maintained network and host-based firewalls to enforce access control policies and filter malicious traffic .<BR>

### Technical Skills
â€¢ Threat management and intelligence, threat hunting techniques and intelligence collection from multiple log and monitoring sources.<BR>
â€¢ Performing digital forensics during and after an incident. Cryptography and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), including encryption, hashing, and
digital signatures. Identity and access management (IAM), including implementing access controls, authentication methods (like MFA), and
privileged access tools.<BR>
â€¢ Incident response, including preparing for, detecting, containing, eradicating, and recovering from security incidents.<BR>
â€¢ Detecting, analyzing, and mitigating attacks, threats, and vulnerabilities, including malware, social engineering, denial-of-service (DoS), and
application attacks.<BR>
